# How To Google üîç

I often get questions from people that I could literally copy and paste into google to find the answer that they're looking for. I know I can't be the only one with this struggle so I made a website for it. I'm sure someone else has made something similar but I thought it would be fun to make something like this myself.

This website will show you how to google <b>any</b> question. It is mostly meant for people like me that get a lot of 'easy-to-google' questions.

## How to use my website

The website is hosted on http://blastbucket.nl
It is fairly simple to use. All you have to do is enter the url into your browser followed by "?q=`question here`"
The URL will look something like this `http://blastbucket.nl?q=How to google`.
The browser will take care of the spaces in the URL so don't worry about that.
